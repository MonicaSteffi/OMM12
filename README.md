OMM12 synthetic bacterial community 

# Data

Data folder contains the following files. all the sequences were downloaded from the respective databases using inhouse scripts which are availbale n script folder. 

1. Downloaded_from_genbank_and_refseq: Genome sequences of OligoMM microbes were downloaded from GenBank and RefSeq databases using inhouser scripts. 
2. Marbouty_genbank_and_refseq_proteins: Contains the protein sequences for each genome, taken from genbank and refseq.
3. Marbouty_genbank_and_refseq_proteins_integrated: Contains the integrated protein sequences for each genome, taken from genbank and refseq.
4. Marbouty_annotations_for_integrated_proteins: Contains the results for the annotations done for the integrated protein sequences from ‘Data\Marbouty_genbank_and_refseq_proteins_integrated’

# Annotation results

We used different softwares such as OperonMapper, KOFAMSCAN, dbCAN2, PULs, RGI and eggNOG to get proper annotations for integrated proteins
